# Prediction-and-Classification-of-Thesis-Scheme

This is a simple project to determine a thesis title scheme based on data that has been trained using the Neural Network, and AdaBoost algorithms.

The accuracy of the Neural Network algorithm is around 77,9 percent and AdaBoost algorithm is around 75,1 percent

Not only for predicting schemes and classifying thesis titles, this project is equipped with a word cloud feature. its function is to see what the focus is on all test data

This project is made with the Orange tool and uses the Ubuntu Linux operating system
